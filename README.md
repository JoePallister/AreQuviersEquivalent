The QuiverMutation.ipynb notebook is to simplify calcualtions with quiver mutations. 

It has functions to:

Apply a single mutation
Apply a sequence of mutations
Obtained equivalent quivers to a given quiver, up to a given distance away
Check if two given quivers are equivalent, up to relabelling, and up to a given distance (they may still be equivalent, but only if we use more mutations)
Check if a quiver is periodic
